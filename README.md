JavaScript Strings Lab
---

Welcome to your first JavaScript lab!

![lab](http://i.giphy.com/NETCsDYm0fL44.gif)

## Objectives

1. Manipulate strings by hand in JavaScript
2. Practice interpolating with template literals

## Lab

You'll find a file called `strings.js` in this directory. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get tests to pass.

Before anything else, make sure that you've installed the required dependencies. Just run `npm install`. (If that doesn't work and you're not using the Learn IDE, make sure you have [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.)

You can run the tests using the `learn` command in your terminal or the Learn IDE. Give that a go now.

All but one test has failed! This is okay, and it's expected — you haven't written any code yet, after all.

In `strings.js`, you'll see four lines of code:

``` javascript
var myString = "";

var concatenatedString = "" + "";

var animal = 'cat';

var interpolatedString = `${animal}`;
```

Each line has a test associated with it. When the tests fail, they show us what the _expected_ value is — your job is to make that expectation a reality by modifying the code provided.

**NOTE**: Because we're dealing with some low-level language features, you might spot some easy ways to "cheat" on this lab, or this lab might seem frustratingly easy. We've given you some starter code to point you in the right direction — try to solve the lab as intended! You can then compare your solution with ours (found in the `solution` branch of this repository).

When your tests are passing, submit your answer with `learn submit` or else create a pull request (use Learn submit if "pull request" sounds a bit terrifying).

Good luck!
